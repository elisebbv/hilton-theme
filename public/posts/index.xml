      <title>Plots to Rival the Heatwave üî•</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The whole &amp;ldquo;Editor is on hiatus üíú&amp;rdquo; thing? What a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I AM. But I&amp;rsquo;m also not. Between beta reads for 2+ friends, two sneaky poetry edits, and a glorious fantasy novel, this editor is keeping her dreams alive by the skin of her teeth. Work/life balance? Never heard of her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I kid. To be fair, I&amp;rsquo;m finding a balance between 3 part-time work contracts, one upper-level course, and a little editing on the side. I promise I even find time to have fun. Climbing on the evenings and weekends, video games for a little unwinding, and I&amp;rsquo;ve naturally found time to read too. See?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fall 2023 and Winter 2024 have gone down in history. In the last eight months, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to finish drafting and revising a 107,000 word fantasy novel; designed, printed, and celebrated the launch of a literary magazine of student art; and signed at least two new freelance contracts with hopes for at least one or two more for Summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feast your eyes&amp;hellip; üëÄ&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-box&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/book-reviews/louden-2024-1.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/book-reviews/louden-2024-2.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/book-reviews/louden-2024-3.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought going on hiatus from freelance contracts was going to eviscerate the tenuous career I began building for myself in 2019. But as I shared with a friend the other day, as soon as the end of my Winter 2024 semester hit, I had opportunities flying at me seemingly from every corner. These opportunities were all connected in one way or another to seeds planted in past weeks, months, or years, but nevertheless they appeared when I felt like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even trying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Spines Ya Crackin&#39;? üìö (BOOK spines, that is)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Book spines! I swear I meant BOOK spines! I get that I&amp;rsquo;m a fantasy author with a penchant for the darker tales (though you cannot accuse me of publishing any tragedies, those will never see beyond the deep, dark reaches of a digital filing cabinet). But come ON.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now 2024. The last time I updated anyone on my reading progress was last year, when I had read 26 books in the first quarter of 2023. My dismal math skills aside, this was a shock to me. And by the end of the final quarter of 2023, we were sitting pretty at &amp;hellip; ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å &amp;hellip; 90! This is quite the adjustment from my original January plan to read (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;checks notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) exactly ONE book per month. One. 1. Uno. Un. Not two. Not three. Not zero. One.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t be taking on new clients for the foreseeable future because &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m back in school! Didn&amp;rsquo;t see that coming (said no one, literally ever).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I told my husband I was done with school for &amp;ldquo;a good while&amp;rdquo; after I finished my editing certificate in 2022, he laughed at me. I defended myself. I&amp;rsquo;d been in school for the past 6 years with no break and only a couple certificates to show for it. I said couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand the idea of being in school again any time soon. I wanted a good, long break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Editing Reflections: Slowing Down &amp; Catching Up üìö</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freelancing seasons cycle between feast or famine so quickly, it can be disorienting to try and look back at what the past few months have held. On the rollercoaster of &amp;ldquo;How much work do I have this month?&amp;rdquo; I went from slowing down at the end of March to busy enough to make my head spin from April to May. And then by June, things were winding down again. The forecast for July looks dry as well, and then promise of showers for August. By September, my whole schedule will change around, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Soft Magic Systems Are So Hard to Write ü™Ñ</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/hard-and-soft-magic-systems/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me two attempts to finish reading &lt;em&gt;For the Throne&lt;/em&gt; by Hannah Whitten. At first, I thought I was just bored because the book started off with different POV characters. But in the end, the thing that was really bothering me was the magic system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soft and hard magic systems are like the difference between Star Wars and &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite space opera is pretty approachable even if you don&amp;rsquo;t care a lick about science, while &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt;, from the author of &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;, will only appeal to those who are willing to learn about the nitty gritty details of the science at play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crows, security robots, seas made of spores, and a subspecies of dragon called a quigutl. Yes, dear friends. You&amp;rsquo;re in for a whole lot of &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; this quarter. If you need any reading material, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you going for a while. My goal was to read 24 books by the end of this year ‚Äî that&amp;rsquo;s one each month, in case you hate math as much as I do. Reason being, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling like reading much at all for a while and didn&amp;rsquo;t think I could manage much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Few More Good Reads: Happy New Year! ü•Ç</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sat down to pick out my top reads of the last quarter of 2022, I looked at my list and thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;Well, this looks a lot more like me.&amp;rdquo; And yet, as I write this, I feel less like myself than I ever have. Aren&amp;rsquo;t people funny paradoxes? Funny isn&amp;rsquo;t the right word, but we use it like that all the time. Funny can mean can mean odd, unsettling, and uncomfortable. But at face value, it&amp;rsquo;s just &amp;hellip; funny.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unexpectedly Expected: 2022 Editing Update</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/unexpectedly-expected-editing-2022/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life really does not go the way we expect it to sometimes, does it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We like to say that a lot. We acknowledge the unexpected as a natural part of life and like to make it sound like we&amp;rsquo;re all aware of how uncertain things can be. But then, when something inevitably doesn&amp;rsquo;t go our way, &lt;strong&gt;PANIC!&lt;/strong&gt; at the Disco.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you asked me today, I would probably say that life is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going my way most of the time. And this is both good and bad news because sometimes those surprises are necessary for growth. Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re pleasant things, sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re not, and I&amp;rsquo;m not always the best person to make a judgement call on that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reading Round-Up ‚Äî September 2022</title>

Is that a lot? Eight books in two months? I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a lot for some people, and not a lot for some, but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot more than I expected from myself this year. In January alone, I read eight books, so by that count, I&amp;rsquo;d have to say I&amp;rsquo;ve slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Nymph Keepers is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that ever feel good to say! But I think it&amp;rsquo;s also a challenge, to move on from a project that big and fill that space with something new. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong; I haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped writing other drafts and working other stories, so there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of projects. But this is a bit of a goodbye ‚Äî a transition from one season into another, or from one focus toward something new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-launch-day&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Launch Day&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have no trouble believing this, but I&amp;rsquo;m still in a bit of a daze: &lt;em&gt;Queen of the Nymphs&lt;/em&gt; is here! Today is the day and Book III of the Nymph Keepers is ready and waiting for you. You can find out how the story ends &lt;a href=&#34;https://books2read.com/queenofthenymphs&#34;&gt;wherever ebooks are sold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But wait!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-made-you-a-treat&#34;&gt;I Made You a Treat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough to do, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d treat you to something a little extra special: Chapters 1 &amp;amp; 2 of &lt;em&gt;Queen of the Nymphs&lt;/em&gt;, read by yours truly. (Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t consider that a treat, in which case, feel free to read those chapters all by yourself! But if you like listening to people read&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Good Writing: My Top 3 Reads of 2022 (So Far)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#1-an-enchantment-of-ravens-by-margaret-rogerson&#34;&gt;An Enchantment of Ravens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;#2-if-we-were-villains-by-ml-rio&#34;&gt;If We Were Villains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;#3-the-love-hypothesis-by-ali-hazelwood&#34;&gt;The Love Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-read-or-not-to-read&#34;&gt;To Read or Not To Read&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can count on one hand the number of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year that have made me want to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve read 30 books so far. Maybe those aren&amp;rsquo;t great odds. Maybe I should be more selective about the books I pick up; maybe I should DNF (did-not-finish) more often. But once I start reading something, I have an excruciatingly hard time stopping until I reach &amp;ldquo;The End.&amp;rdquo; If I consider stopping because I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying it, I invariably end up feeling guilty. &lt;em&gt;Am I just not in the right mood for it? Am I in a bad headspace with writing at the moment, and I&amp;rsquo;m taking it out on this poor author?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Types of Editing</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-to-start&#34;&gt;Where to Start&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Editing has many facets, but it tends to be narrowed down to just one: rules. Grammar, punctuation, typos ‚Äî it‚Äôs the first thing we look for when someone asks us to read through the tricky email, announcement, or advertisement they‚Äôre writing. Rules are straightforward. They present a clear right and wrong, and as long as you abide by them, you should be fine. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with language, and English is just as bad for this as any other language, is that the rules are never simple. There are exceptions to every rule and the rules change over time as languages become modernized, words take on new meanings, and old sayings lose their effectiveness. The role of an editor becomes about so much more than catching a stray typo and fixing the tense of a verb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
