      <title>Plots to Rival the Heatwave 🔥</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The whole &amp;ldquo;Editor is on hiatus 💜&amp;rdquo; thing? What a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I AM. But I&amp;rsquo;m also not. Between beta reads for 2+ friends, two sneaky poetry edits, and a glorious fantasy novel, this editor is keeping her dreams alive by the skin of her teeth. Work/life balance? Never heard of her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I kid. To be fair, I&amp;rsquo;m finding a balance between 3 part-time work contracts, one upper-level course, and a little editing on the side. I promise I even find time to have fun. Climbing on the evenings and weekends, video games for a little unwinding, and I&amp;rsquo;ve naturally found time to read too. See?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Spines Ya Crackin&#39;? 📚 (BOOK spines, that is)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Book spines! I swear I meant BOOK spines! I get that I&amp;rsquo;m a fantasy author with a penchant for the darker tales (though you cannot accuse me of publishing any tragedies, those will never see beyond the deep, dark reaches of a digital filing cabinet). But come ON.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now 2024. The last time I updated anyone on my reading progress was last year, when I had read 26 books in the first quarter of 2023. My dismal math skills aside, this was a shock to me. And by the end of the final quarter of 2023, we were sitting pretty at &amp;hellip; 🥁 🥁 🥁 &amp;hellip; 90! This is quite the adjustment from my original January plan to read (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;checks notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) exactly ONE book per month. One. 1. Uno. Un. Not two. Not three. Not zero. One.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Soft Magic Systems Are So Hard to Write 🪄</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/hard-and-soft-magic-systems/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me two attempts to finish reading &lt;em&gt;For the Throne&lt;/em&gt; by Hannah Whitten. At first, I thought I was just bored because the book started off with different POV characters. But in the end, the thing that was really bothering me was the magic system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soft and hard magic systems are like the difference between Star Wars and &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite space opera is pretty approachable even if you don&amp;rsquo;t care a lick about science, while &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt;, from the author of &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;, will only appeal to those who are willing to learn about the nitty gritty details of the science at play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Meet My New Favourite Author, Plus a Few More 📚</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/meet-my-new-favourite-author-2023/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crows, security robots, seas made of spores, and a subspecies of dragon called a quigutl. Yes, dear friends. You&amp;rsquo;re in for a whole lot of &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; this quarter. If you need any reading material, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you going for a while. My goal was to read 24 books by the end of this year — that&amp;rsquo;s one each month, in case you hate math as much as I do. Reason being, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling like reading much at all for a while and didn&amp;rsquo;t think I could manage much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Few More Good Reads: Happy New Year! 🥂</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/happy-new-year-2022/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sat down to pick out my top reads of the last quarter of 2022, I looked at my list and thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;Well, this looks a lot more like me.&amp;rdquo; And yet, as I write this, I feel less like myself than I ever have. Aren&amp;rsquo;t people funny paradoxes? Funny isn&amp;rsquo;t the right word, but we use it like that all the time. Funny can mean can mean odd, unsettling, and uncomfortable. But at face value, it&amp;rsquo;s just &amp;hellip; funny.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reading Round-Up — September 2022</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#the-winternight-trilogy&#34;&gt;Skip to the books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;slowing-down-but-never-stopping&#34;&gt;Slowing Down But Never Stopping&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In August, I popped in here to talk about &amp;ldquo;good writing.&amp;rdquo; By that, I meant the three books I had read that year that made me say &amp;ldquo;I want to write like that one day.&amp;rdquo; (That&amp;rsquo;s the author&amp;rsquo;s version of &amp;ldquo;I want to be like them when I grow up.&amp;rdquo;) Since then, I have read eight books. Is that a lot? Eight books in two months? I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a lot for some people, and not a lot for some, but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot more than I expected from myself this year. In January alone, I read eight books, so by that count, I&amp;rsquo;d have to say I&amp;rsquo;ve slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Good Writing: My Top 3 Reads of 2022 (So Far)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#1-an-enchantment-of-ravens-by-margaret-rogerson&#34;&gt;An Enchantment of Ravens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;#2-if-we-were-villains-by-ml-rio&#34;&gt;If We Were Villains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;#3-the-love-hypothesis-by-ali-hazelwood&#34;&gt;The Love Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-read-or-not-to-read&#34;&gt;To Read or Not To Read&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can count on one hand the number of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year that have made me want to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve read 30 books so far. Maybe those aren&amp;rsquo;t great odds. Maybe I should be more selective about the books I pick up; maybe I should DNF (did-not-finish) more often. But once I start reading something, I have an excruciatingly hard time stopping until I reach &amp;ldquo;The End.&amp;rdquo; If I consider stopping because I&amp;rsquo;m not enjoying it, I invariably end up feeling guilty. &lt;em&gt;Am I just not in the right mood for it? Am I in a bad headspace with writing at the moment, and I&amp;rsquo;m taking it out on this poor author?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
