      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Nymph Keepers is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that ever feel good to say! But I think it&amp;rsquo;s also a challenge, to move on from a project that big and fill that space with something new. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong; I haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped writing other drafts and working other stories, so there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of projects. But this is a bit of a goodbye — a transition from one season into another, or from one focus toward something new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-launch-day&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Launch Day&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have no trouble believing this, but I&amp;rsquo;m still in a bit of a daze: &lt;em&gt;Queen of the Nymphs&lt;/em&gt; is here! Today is the day and Book III of the Nymph Keepers is ready and waiting for you. You can find out how the story ends &lt;a href=&#34;https://books2read.com/queenofthenymphs&#34;&gt;wherever ebooks are sold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But wait!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-made-you-a-treat&#34;&gt;I Made You a Treat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough to do, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d treat you to something a little extra special: Chapters 1 &amp;amp; 2 of &lt;em&gt;Queen of the Nymphs&lt;/em&gt;, read by yours truly. (Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t consider that a treat, in which case, feel free to read those chapters all by yourself! But if you like listening to people read&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;spoilers-for-heart-of-the-forest-ahead&#34;&gt;SPOILERS FOR HEART OF THE FOREST AHEAD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the start of Heart of the Forest: Book II of the Nymph Keepers, the war between Ireece and Galia has just begun, sparked by the death of the ambassador — the Nymph Keeper — who Jay killed. Meanwhile, a new plot unravels in Fethens, threatening to unravel Forest’s life as court herbalist: Silic and Protis secretly poison the king of Ireece with Hellfire in a zealous attempt to put Terryn on the throne.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;spoilers-for-roots-of-blood-ahead&#34;&gt;SPOILERS FOR ROOTS OF BLOOD AHEAD&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After Jay saves Forest from the Butcher — the Nymph Keeper he had originally been working for in order to get the nymph blood he needed to help his sister — he takes her to his home city of Fethens. Forest expected this to be just another stop in a life of horrors. She tries to escape to the mountains, where she finds the rumoured mountain nymphs and hopes for refuge, but as a forest nymph, she cannot survive underground. After Silic brings her back to the city of Fethens, he introduces Forest to his found family of nymphs, and she begins to feel more at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
