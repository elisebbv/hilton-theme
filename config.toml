On many occasions, she left me positive comments throughout the editing process, that reminded me of why I wrote this book—which was incredibly helpful in my moments of doubt."

I worked with her twice through a university level creative writing program, the first time I have ever continued with someone for a second year. Elise has a great eye for editing. She's able to balance both a writer's strengths with also ensuring they understand where there are challenges and how to address those. She's kind and supportive, but not afraid to also be honest and direct. This can be hard to find in an editor. The students who worked with her provided frequent feedback about how much they enjoyed working with her and finding her input invaluable. Overall, Elise gracefully balances between the creative and professional sides of the writing industry. I would gladly work with her in the future."

We consider ourselves very lucky to have Elise (and her skills, knowledge, and abilities) on our team."

Her clients are lucky to have her on their side as her generosity and kindness apply equally to everyone in her life. She and I studied together at SFU, bumped into each other on social media, and continue to support one another in our network. She always impresses me with her knowledge of her genre, writing craft, and editing mechanics.
