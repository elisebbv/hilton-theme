## Releasing August 12th…

In the final book of The Nymph Keepers, Forest struggles with her duties as court herbalist and the expectations of a future queen as the rot ravaging Galia’s lands creeps over the borders into the other provinces.

[And pre-orders are now OPEN.](https://books2read.com/queenofthenymphs)

That’s right. After weeks (months) of saying “soon,” I’m here to tell you that Queen of the Nymphs is HERE. And in the words of The Incredibles, “It’s bigger… [and] It’s better!”

That’s really all I’ve got for you this time. If you want the real, heartfelt, final word, you’ll just have to read all the way to the end of the book and through the Acknowledgements. I have so many people to thank!

In the meantime, I’ll just put a drumroll audio clip on repeat for you while I go complete my final course toward my editing certificate, record a couple podcast episodes, and edit a book about a dog and what it means to learn to love. Trust me: Queen of the Nymphs will be here in no time.

Join me and Forest on August 12th to see how the world- er- story ends!

xoxo,

Elise
