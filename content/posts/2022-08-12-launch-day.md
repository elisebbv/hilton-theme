## It's Launch Day

Maybe you have no trouble believing this, but I'm still in a bit of a daze: *Queen of the Nymphs* is here! Today is the day and Book III of the Nymph Keepers is ready and waiting for you. You can find out how the story ends [wherever ebooks are sold](https://books2read.com/queenofthenymphs).

But wait!

## I Made You a Treat

Because I don't have enough to do, I thought I'd treat you to something a little extra special: Chapters 1 & 2 of *Queen of the Nymphs*, read by yours truly. (Maybe you don't consider that a treat, in which case, feel free to read those chapters all by yourself! But if you like listening to people read...)

Without further ado, I present to you, *Queen of the Nymphs: Book III of the Nymph Keepers*. Join me and Forest to see how the story ends.
