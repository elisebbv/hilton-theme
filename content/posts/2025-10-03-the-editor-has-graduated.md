I have wanted a Bachelor's degree since the day my mother told me she wished she'd finished her post-secondary education. Nine years and three post-secondary schools later, I have what I wanted.

_(To see what I’ve been up to in my classes, [check out my design portfolio](https://design.elisevolkman.com).)_

I finished the last two classes of my Bachelor's degree in August 2025. I won't walk the stage, but I will mark the moment, in my own way, with my own people. I will stand on the other side of this self-imposed mission, arms open wide in relief and jubilation, and I will take the time to tell myself, "That was a job well done." 

For a little while there, I had convinced myself I didn't need it. I had work, I was busy enough, and the slog of jumping through hoops for a largely meaningless piece of paper just didn't seem worth the expense of time, or money. And yet, even when I took a break from school for a little while, that age-old longing wouldn't go away. I filled the time with other certificates and contract work. That dream from my younger self didn't let me go.

Here at the other end of it, I reflect on the tension in the waiting; a tightrope strung between the almost and the not quite. As I walked the line between the two these last two semesters, I found myself living life at two speeds at once. 

1. The speed of the undergraduate starting to see that light at the end of the long 4-year tunnel (what do you mean I'm not done yet?). 

2. The speed of the good ol' 9-5—that is to say, far too fast (what do you mean it's October already??).

Here at the other end of it, the thing is done. The dream is achieved. Class of 2025 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in creative writing and graphic design: here I am. It has been a privilege and an honour to have spend the last 2 years thinking about and making art. Thank you to everyone who helped me get here, and cheered me on along the way!

P.S., the editor's hiatus continues, but stay tuned for what's next! (Hint: even I don't know what to expect yet.)
