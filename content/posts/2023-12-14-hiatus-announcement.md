I won't be taking on new clients for the foreseeable future because ... I'm back in school! Didn't see that coming (said no one, literally ever).

When I told my husband I was done with school for "a good while" after I finished my editing certificate in 2022, he laughed at me. I defended myself. I'd been in school for the past 6 years with no break and only a couple certificates to show for it. I said couldn't stand the idea of being in school again any time soon. I wanted a good, long break.

Six months later, I was re-applying to university to finish a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree that I've longed for since I was a teenager.

Don't get me wrong; as a teen, I had no idea what I wanted my degree to be _in_. I just knew that I wanted one. I've chosen my fields of study through a series of trial and error, tranferred credits, and program availability at my local uni, landing on (drumroll, please) ... a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and Graphic Design. So, while I balance part-time work and classes, and the friends and family I'm committed to seeing on a semi-regular basis, managing client edits with reasonable timelines is one juggling ball too many.

I'll be wrapping up current projects with my last few tasks of 2023 and then closing for new contracts until I can wrap this lovely life-goal up and hang that piece of paper on my wall with pride.

Wish me luck! üçÄ
