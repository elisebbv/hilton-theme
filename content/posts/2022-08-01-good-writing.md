## To Read or Not To Read
I can count on one hand the number of books I've read this year that have made me want to *write*. And I've read 30 books so far. Maybe those aren't great odds. Maybe I should be more selective about the books I pick up; maybe I should DNF (did-not-finish) more often. But once I start reading something, I have an excruciatingly hard time stopping until I reach "The End." If I consider stopping because I'm not enjoying it, I invariably end up feeling guilty. *Am I just not in the right mood for it? Am I in a bad headspace with writing at the moment, and I'm taking it out on this poor author?*

However, there is a part of me that believes every book I read is a learning experience. "Reading is research" is the mantra you will hear Miraya and I use over on [The Tea Grannies Podcast](https://shows.acast.com/the-tea-grannies) every single episode. (*Basically* every episode. My father once told me "exaggeration is going to get you into trouble one day" and I guess I still haven't learned my lesson.) I guess my strategy is to devour as many books as I can in the hopes that a few of them will be exceptional. I guess, with a wild trajectory like that, failure isn't really possible? The beauty of this strategy is that I collect a TBR (to-be-read) list at a ravenous rate and never run out of titles to choose from (which is simultaneously bad for the decision-anxiety I go through on a day-to-day basis, also courtesy of my father &mdash; thanks, Dad!). What's more, I don't even read the summaries for some of those titles. So when I pick them up (based on cover alone &mdash; yes I am fickle and judge books that way, shamelessly) I am occasionally surprised and blown away by the premise, characters, and my sheer enjoyment of the title(s).

And those few-and-far-between books are the ones that make me want to sit down at my keyboard, or with my writing-tablet-pen in hand, and write the next best thing. The next best book. Something, anything, to get me closer to that elusive feeling of elation I get when I read a story that just bewitches me, body and soul.

These are my top 3 reads of the first half of 2022.

### #1 *An Enchantment of Ravens* by Margaret Rogerson
Fantasy. Of course, there's one of these on the list. But if you expected my top reads to *all* be fantasy, you're going to be sorely disappointed. (Or ... pleasantly surprised? Depends on whether you're my father or not! Sorry, Dad, I still haven't learned to branch my reading environs beyond fiction. But I've opened up to other genres! A little!).

[*An Enchantment of Ravens*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/190eee2a-bead-409d-9e08-a21af1beeeed) is a fae/fairy/faerie story through-and-through. If you're not familiar with Holly Black and S.J. Maas and the fae writing goddesses of the twenty-first century, you probably won't have heard of this one either, but after devouring those other series, this stand-alone novel was a breath of fresh fae air. The way that Rogerson describes the fae world, the way the magic works, and the way the fae interact with humans, was just that &mdash; refreshing. Her writing is quick, some would call it rushed, but it's also breathtaking and colourful. I think I felt right at home because I love a good fast-paced fantasy story with lots of action and romance.

### #2 *If We Were Villains* by M.L. Rio
This novel was a mystery bordering on literary fiction. If poetic-leaning prose isn't your thing, maybe give the summary a quick skim and be on your merry way. I dove into [*If We Were Villains*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f28e49bd-b6ec-49a3-99e5-4886c96077c9) with trepidation (it's not fantasy, so how could I know if I would even *like* it?), but I quickly became engrossed. The characters, the emotional turmoil, the drama (literally &mdash; they're theatre students), the slowly-unravelling mystery of it all... By the end, I was nearly catatonic with the sheer volume of my awe (and Dad, for the record, that's not exaggeration &mdash; not totally). I closed the book, held it to my chest, I was on the verge of tears, and I said to myself, "I want to write something that good one day. I **_will_** write something that good one day."

I'm fairly certain that "one day" isn't here yet, but I'm still riding the high of that story in my memory. It gives me a target to shoot for, even if that target is blurry and intangible and hopelessly out of reach. *"Shoot for the stars,"* they said, and then they built a rocket and did just that. So it's my turn now.

### #3 *The Love Hypothesis* by Ali Hazelwood
Lastly and quite possibly most importantly in this list, the *romance* book. Before you turn up your nose and judge me for my provincial house-wife-ness, just know that I will defend this book in a fight to the death. (Sorry, Dad. Can't seem to get this exaggeration lesson right.)

I started [*The Love Hypothesis*](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/98385e64-9c08-48bd-a3fc-c7751a9341fe) last night, at around 10 PM, on recommendation from two close writer friends (I'm sure you know who you are). One of them adored it (she's a biologist, so that makes sense &mdash; women in STEM abound in this story, and it's *glorious*). The other friend enjoyed it with a few minor complaints. I stayed up until 1 AM reading it, realized I was about halfway, that I had just reached probably the mid-book crisis, and that I still had to sleep and be productive in the morning. I have stayed up until 4 AM reading other books (*If We Were Villains,* I'm looking at you), and I nearly did with this one, too. But I promised myself to finish it in the morning and chose to let myself sleep (to protect husband from my moodiness; you're welcome, husband).

This book started with the kiss-a-stranger-to-get-out-of-something trope, culminated into the fake-dating trope, turned into a hot, spicy mess with the lack-of-communication-leads-to-misunderstandings-about-unrequited-love trope, and resolved in the most perfect touch-her-and-I'll-kill-you trope moment &mdash; leading to much cuteness and a happily-ever-after ending better than any I have read in a long time. I didn't want the book to end. But at the same time, I read it all the way through with a kind of fevered intensity, so it's a lot better for my cardiovascular system that it did end, eventually. A re-read may be in order whenever I'm in the mood for something funny and heartwarming. Olive x Adam forever.

## Until Next Time
I'll see you later for my end-of-year round-up, maybe. Probably. Who knows if I'll remember or if this blogging thing will pan out. Now that [Queen of the Nymphs: Book III of the Nymph Keepers](https://books2read.com/queenofthenymphs) is set for release, I expect I'll be wrapped up in obsessively writing my next book before long.
