> I offer manuscript consultations for the exploring author and in-depth editing services for authors with specific goals for their manuscript.

No sure what you need? No worries! You can request a free sample edit of your manuscript to see if weâ€™ll be a good fit. All I ask is that you have a completed draft of your story ready when you make your request.

### The Budget Option: Manuscript Consultation
A manuscript consultation provides you with a high-level overview of how to strengthen and improve your story. This is a great budget option for authors who just need a little direction with where to start, or where to go next and aren't ready for a full developmental edit yet (or can't afford to pay for one).

Includes:
- A complimentary 15-minute introduction meeting 
- An Editorial Letter from me, highlighting big-picture feedback about the overall plot, characters, pacing, and any key areas to focus on strengthening.

### The Full-Meal Deal: Developmental Editing
The Developmental Edit is my favourite editing stage for fiction manuscripts, where we comb through the story to really tighten up or expand on the plot, the world, and the characters. For me, this is where the story really comes to life. The rest (copy editing, proofreading), while crucial, tends to be more detail-oriented and less âœ¨funâœ¨.

A developmental edit provides you with big-picture feedback; everything from character development and plot structure to style, pacing, and continuity. This is more in-depth than a manuscript consultation and I will offer specific suggestions for rewriting, adding, or removing content as necessary.

Includes:
- A complimentary 15-minute introduction meeting 
- An Editorial Letter from me, outlining the main feedback beats
- A copy of your manuscript with comments and reflections recorded throughout using the comments and suggesting features in Word or Google Docs (Track Changes)
- A 1 hour video consultation call to discuss any questions about the overall feedback 

### Just Make It Right: Copy Editing
This is where we get into the woes of grammar rules, terrifying typos, and controversial debates about commas. Now, while Developmental Editing may be my favourite, that doesn't mean I don't like copy editing. You might not, because who wants to keep track of all those rules anyway? But the answer is me. I do. I'm the nerd.

A copy edit provides you with feedback on correctness, accuracy, and consistency. This stage of editing focuses on grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and overall stylistic rules for the manuscript.

Includes:
- A copy of your manuscript with my edits and suggestions recorded throughout using the comments and suggesting features in Word or Google Docs (Track Changes)

### The Final Sweep: Proofreading
This one's for you, anxiety. When you've gone through copy editing and you've got your book laid out in a professionally designed PDF and all that's left is the actual publishing step, this editing stage is to help assuage those fears of lingering typos and tricksy little errors. When files are going back and forth between author, editor, designer, and back again, it can be easy for new errors to sneak in. And that's where the proofread comes in!

A proofread is the final stage of editing after your book design has been finalized and laid out in a PDF format. This is the final editing step before the manuscript is ready for publishing.

Includes:
- Corrections and comments on the PDF of your manuscript for any remaining errors such as typos, layout issues, spacing, or other small errors introduced at any point in the editing or design process
