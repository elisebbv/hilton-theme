## What Are You Hoping For?

I offer manuscript consultations for the exploring author and in-depth editing services for authors with specific goals for their manuscript.

### Manuscript Consultation
A manuscript consultation provides you with a high-level overview of how to strengthen and improve your story. This is a great budget option for authors who just need a little direction with where to start, or where to go next.

Includes:
- A complimentary 15-minute introduction meeting 
- An Editorial Letter from me, highlighting big-picture feedback about the overall plot, characters, pacing, and any key areas to focus on strengthening.

### Developmental Editing
A developmental edit provides you with big-picture feedback; everything from character development and plot structure to style, pacing, and continuity. This is more in-depth than a manuscript consultation and I will offer specific suggestions for rewriting, adding, or removing content as necessary.

Includes:
- A complimentary 15-minute introduction meeting 
- An Editorial Letter from me, outlining the main feedback beats
- A copy of your manuscript with comments and reflections recorded throughout using the comments and suggesting features in Word and/or Google Docs (Track Changes)
- A 1 hour video consultation call to discuss any questions about the overall feedback 

### Copy Editing
A copy edit provides you with feedback on correctness, accuracy, and consistency. This stage of editing focuses on grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and overall stylistic rules that the manuscript follows.

Includes:
- A copy of your manuscript with my edits and suggestions recorded throughout using the comments and suggesting features in Word and/or Google Docs (Track Changes)

### Proofreading
A proofread is the final stage of editing after your book design has been finalized and laid out in PDF form. This is usually the final step before going ahead to hitting publish or print on your book.

Includes:
- A PDF of your manuscript with corrections and comments on any remaining errors such as typos, layout issues, spacing, or other small errors introduced at any point in the editing or design process

### Other Services

If you'd like assistance with drafting or rewriting copy for your website, I'd love to help! I have experience with Wordpress, Hugo, Wix, and Squarespace.
