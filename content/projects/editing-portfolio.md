I offer manuscript consultations for the exploring author and in-depth editing services for authors with specific goals for their manuscript. That means everything from developmental editing and copy editing down to the nitty gritty of a proofread.

I enjoy a variety of speculative fiction genres, including fantasy, science-fiction, dystopian, gothic, and contemporary, and I like everything from middle grade up to and including adult. Through my work as an editor with [Writer’s Block Solutions](https://writersblocksolutions.ca/), [The Self Publishing Agency](https://theselfpublishingagency.com/), and indie authors, I’ve also had the pleasure of editing cookbooks, memoirs, self-help, and picture books.
