## <mark style="background-color: #87a6b1; color: #ffffff;">I'm on hiatus</mark> from editing projects while I head back to school to complete my degree. Thanks for understanding!

To request a free sample edit, please include the following:
- Title
- Genre
- Word count
- A brief summary of your story
- [What kind of editing you're looking for](/services) (and if you don't know, that's okay!)

For all other enquiries, a greeting and your message should do it. Feel free to tell me a bit about yourself too! I look forward to e-meeting you.
